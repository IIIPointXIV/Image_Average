# Image Average

Takes a directory and creates an average image from it.

## How To Use
1. Download latest release
2. Open a command line in the exe's directory
3. Type:
> image_avg.exe "PATH OF IMAGES"
4. Wait for it to process. It may take a while depending on how big the images are and how many of them there are.

## Options
-Put true or false after the path to change how it treats transparency. True means it will ignore pixels from images that do not exist at that point. Click [true](https://github.com/IIIPointXIV/Image_Average/blob/main/false.png?raw=true) or [false](https://github.com/IIIPointXIV/Image_Average/blob/main/true.png?raw=true) to see previews.
